# Upstream Sync Attempt

- Added the `upstream` remote pointing at `https://github.com/volt29/policy-spark-compare.git`.
- Attempted to fetch `main` from the upstream remote, but the request prompted for GitHub credentials and ultimately failed because the repository could not be accessed from this environment.
- As a result, the merge step (`git merge upstream/main`) could not proceed locally.

If you have valid credentials, rerun:

```bash
git fetch upstream main
git checkout work
git merge upstream/main
```

Resolve any conflicts that appear and rerun the project's verification commands before pushing the updated branch.
