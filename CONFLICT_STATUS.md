# PR #19 Conflict Review Status

Unable to inspect conflict options because the repository snapshot only contains the `work` branch. Access to the latest `main` branch (or the incoming branch from PR #19) is required to view the `<<<<<<<` / `=======` / `>>>>>>>` hunks and choose among the three resolution options provided by GitHub. The upstream remote `https://github.com/volt29/policy-spark-compare.git` requires credentials, so the branch data could not be fetched.

To proceed once access is available:
1. Add the upstream remote and authenticate so `git fetch upstream main` succeeds.
2. Check out `work` and merge `upstream/main` locally to surface the conflicts.
3. For each conflicted file, inspect the local, base, and incoming sections to decide which option (or combination) preserves both the new SourceTooltip integration and the base updates.
